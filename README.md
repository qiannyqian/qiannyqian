Hi, it's Qian here! I'm a front-end software engineer dabbling in full-stack development.

### About Me 🎏

I'm an experienced software engineer with 5+ years of experience, specialising in web and front-end development. While I initially have a background in Psychology, I have also gone through a full-stack Ruby on Rails web development bootcamp, and worked in tech ever since. I enjoy using clean, modular code to create UI that provides a great user experience. I also enjoy learning and keeping up to date with the latest tech trends.

### Community Development 👾

- **TechLadies** is a community for women in Asia to connect, learn, and advance as programmers. I was part of the community management team to engage with the Techladies community.

I was the social media manager and curated and managed social media channels (Facebook and Twitter) for the 2019 edition of JSConf.asia.
